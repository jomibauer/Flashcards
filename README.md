# Flashcards

Hi!  I've run into a roadblock when trying to seed my database.  I'm trying to create a database with two main Models that have a one-to-many relationship.  FlashcardFolders contain a collection of Flashcard objects.  It seems that seeding relational entities is sometimes difficult, but I've found what seems to be a solution here: https://wildermuth.com/2018/08/12/Seeding-Related-Entities-in-EF-Core-2-1-s-HasData()

I've implemented the solution suggested in the link, but my collection of Flashcard entities is not being inserted into the FlashcardFolder table.  I've been stuck here for a while, and I'm not sure what to do now.

Let me know if you need to know anything else.

Thanks for offerring to help!
